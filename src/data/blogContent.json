      "content": "# Modern JavaScript Features Every Developer Should Know\n\nJavaScript continues to evolve rapidly, with new features and improvements being added regularly. As we move through 2025, staying current with modern JavaScript features is essential for writing efficient, maintainable, and performant code. This comprehensive guide covers the most important features every developer should master.\n\n## Introduction to Modern JavaScript\n\nJavaScript has come a long way since its early days. With ECMAScript specifications being released annually, the language has gained powerful features that make development more productive and enjoyable. Understanding these features is crucial for:\n\n- Writing cleaner, more readable code\n- Improving application performance\n- Staying competitive in the job market\n- Leveraging modern development tools and frameworks\n\n## ES2020-2025 Key Features\n\n### Optional Chaining (?.)\n\nOptional chaining allows you to safely access deeply nested object properties without having to check each reference in the chain.\n\n```javascript\n// Old way\nif (user && user.address && user.address.street) {\n  console.log(user.address.street);\n}\n\n// Modern way with optional chaining\nconsole.log(user?.address?.street);\n\n// Works with arrays and function calls too\nconst firstItem = items?.[0];\nconst result = api.getData?.();\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduces boilerplate code\n- Prevents TypeError exceptions\n- Makes code more readable\n- Safer property access\n\n### Nullish Coalescing (??)\n\nThe nullish coalescing operator provides a way to handle null or undefined values without affecting other falsy values like 0 or empty strings.\n\n```javascript\n// Problem with logical OR\nconst config = {\n  timeout: 0,\n  retries: null,\n  debug: false\n};\n\n// This gives unexpected results\nconst timeout = config.timeout || 5000; // Returns 5000, not 0!\n\n// Nullish coalescing solves this\nconst timeout = config.timeout ?? 5000; // Returns 0\nconst retries = config.retries ?? 3; // Returns 3\nconst debug = config.debug ?? true; // Returns false\n```\n\n### BigInt for Large Numbers\n\nBigInt allows you to work with integers larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.\n\n```javascript\n// Regular numbers have limits\nconsole.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991\n\n// BigInt can handle much larger numbers\nconst bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;\nconst anotherBig = BigInt('9007199254740992');\n\n// Operations with BigInt\nconst sum = bigNumber + anotherBig;\nconst product = bigNumber * 2n;\n```\n\n### Dynamic Imports\n\nDynamic imports allow you to load modules conditionally and asynchronously.\n\n```javascript\n// Conditional module loading\nif (shouldUseFeature) {\n  const { feature } = await import('./feature.js');\n  feature.init();\n}\n\n// Lazy loading for performance\nconst loadChart = async () => {\n  const { Chart } = await import('./chart-library.js');\n  return new Chart();\n};\n\n// Error handling\ntry {\n  const module = await import('./optional-module.js');\n  module.doSomething();\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log('Module not available');\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Async/Await Patterns\n\n### Top-Level Await\n\nYou can now use await at the module level without wrapping it in an async function.\n\n```javascript\n// module.js\nconst config = await fetch('/api/config').then(r => r.json());\nconst db = await connectToDatabase(config.dbUrl);\n\nexport { config, db };\n```\n\n### Promise.allSettled()\n\nUnlike Promise.all(), this method waits for all promises to settle (resolve or reject).\n\n```javascript\nconst promises = [\n  fetch('/api/users'),\n  fetch('/api/posts'),\n  fetch('/api/comments')\n];\n\nconst results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);\n\nresults.forEach((result, index) => {\n  if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {\n    console.log(`Request ${index} succeeded:`, result.value);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Request ${index} failed:`, result.reason);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Async Generators\n\nCombine async/await with generators for powerful data streaming.\n\n```javascript\nasync function* fetchPages(url) {\n  let page = 1;\n  let hasMore = true;\n  \n  while (hasMore) {\n    const response = await fetch(`${url}?page=${page}`);\n    const data = await response.json();\n    \n    yield data.items;\n    \n    hasMore = data.hasNext;\n    page++;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nfor await (const pageItems of fetchPages('/api/data')) {\n  processItems(pageItems);\n}\n```\n\n## Modern Array and Object Methods\n\n### Array.prototype.at()\n\nAccess array elements with negative indices.\n\n```javascript\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n// Old way\nconsole.log(arr[arr.length - 1]); // 5\n\n// New way\nconsole.log(arr.at(-1)); // 5\nconsole.log(arr.at(-2)); // 4\n```\n\n### Object.hasOwn()\n\nA safer alternative to hasOwnProperty.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { name: 'John', age: 30 };\n\n// Old way (can be problematic)\nobj.hasOwnProperty('name');\n\n// New way (safer)\nObject.hasOwn(obj, 'name'); // true\n```\n\n### Logical Assignment Operators\n\nCombine logical operators with assignment.\n\n```javascript\n// OR assignment (||=)\nlet config = {};\nconfig.theme ||= 'dark'; // Assigns 'dark' if config.theme is falsy\n\n// AND assignment (&&=)\nlet user = { name: 'John' };\nuser.name &&= user.name.toUpperCase(); // Only if name exists\n\n// Nullish assignment (??=)\nlet settings = { timeout: 0 };\nsettings.timeout ??= 5000; // Doesn't change 0 to 5000\nsettings.retries ??= 3; // Assigns 3 if retries is null/undefined\n```\n\n## Destructuring and Spread Patterns\n\n### Advanced Destructuring\n\n```javascript\n// Nested destructuring with defaults\nconst user = {\n  personal: {\n    name: 'John',\n    address: {\n      city: 'New York'\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nconst {\n  personal: {\n    name,\n    address: { city, country = 'USA' }\n  }\n} = user;\n\n// Array destructuring with rest\nconst [first, second, ...others] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n// Swapping variables\nlet a = 1, b = 2;\n[a, b] = [b, a]; // a = 2, b = 1\n```\n\n### Object and Array Spread\n\n```javascript\n// Object merging with overrides\nconst defaults = { theme: 'light', lang: 'en' };\nconst userPrefs = { theme: 'dark' };\nconst config = { ...defaults, ...userPrefs };\n\n// Conditional spreading\nconst apiCall = {\n  url: '/api/data',\n  method: 'GET',\n  ...(includeAuth && { headers: { Authorization: token } })\n};\n\n// Array manipulation\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst moreNumbers = [0, ...numbers, 4, 5];\n```\n\n## Modern Class Features\n\n### Private Fields and Methods\n\n```javascript\nclass BankAccount {\n  // Private fields\n  #balance = 0;\n  #accountNumber;\n  \n  constructor(accountNumber) {\n    this.#accountNumber = accountNumber;\n  }\n  \n  // Private method\n  #validateAmount(amount) {\n    return amount > 0 && typeof amount === 'number';\n  }\n  \n  // Public methods\n  deposit(amount) {\n    if (this.#validateAmount(amount)) {\n      this.#balance += amount;\n      return this.#balance;\n    }\n    throw new Error('Invalid amount');\n  }\n  \n  getBalance() {\n    return this.#balance;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Static Initialization Blocks\n\n```javascript\nclass DatabaseConnection {\n  static #connection;\n  static #isConnected = false;\n  \n  static {\n    // Static initialization block\n    this.#connect()\n      .then(() => {\n        this.#isConnected = true;\n        console.log('Database connected');\n      })\n      .catch(console.error);\n  }\n  \n  static async #connect() {\n    // Connection logic\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## New Built-in APIs\n\n### Temporal API (Proposal Stage)\n\nA modern date/time API to replace the problematic Date object.\n\n```javascript\n// Current date and time\nconst now = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO();\n\n// Creating specific dates\nconst birthday = Temporal.PlainDate.from('2024-12-25');\nconst meeting = Temporal.PlainTime.from('14:30');\n\n// Date arithmetic\nconst nextWeek = today.add({ days: 7 });\nconst lastMonth = today.subtract({ months: 1 });\n\n// Duration calculations\nconst duration = end.since(start);\nconsole.log(duration.total('hours'));\n```\n\n### Web Streams API\n\nHandle streaming data efficiently in the browser.\n\n```javascript\n// Reading a stream\nconst response = await fetch('/large-file.json');\nconst reader = response.body.getReader();\n\nwhile (true) {\n  const { done, value } = await reader.read();\n  if (done) break;\n  \n  // Process chunk\n  processChunk(value);\n}\n\n// Creating a custom stream\nconst customStream = new ReadableStream({\n  start(controller) {\n    // Initialize\n  },\n  pull(controller) {\n    // Generate more data\n    controller.enqueue(generateData());\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization Features\n\n### WeakMap and WeakSet\n\nMemory-efficient collections that don't prevent garbage collection.\n\n```javascript\n// WeakMap for metadata\nconst elementData = new WeakMap();\n\nfunction attachData(element, data) {\n  elementData.set(element, data);\n}\n\nfunction getData(element) {\n  return elementData.get(element);\n}\n\n// When element is removed from DOM,\n// associated data is automatically garbage collected\n```\n\n### Proxy for Advanced Metaprogramming\n\n```javascript\n// Create a reactive object\nfunction createReactive(target, onChange) {\n  return new Proxy(target, {\n    set(obj, prop, value) {\n      const oldValue = obj[prop];\n      obj[prop] = value;\n      onChange(prop, value, oldValue);\n      return true;\n    },\n    \n    get(obj, prop) {\n      if (typeof obj[prop] === 'function') {\n        return obj[prop].bind(obj);\n      }\n      return obj[prop];\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst state = createReactive(\n  { count: 0 },\n  (prop, newVal, oldVal) => {\n    console.log(`${prop} changed from ${oldVal} to ${newVal}`);\n  }\n);\n\nstate.count = 5; // Logs: count changed from 0 to 5\n```\n\n## Module System Enhancements\n\n### Import Maps\n\nConfigure module resolution in browsers.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"lodash\": \"/node_modules/lodash/index.js\",\n    \"react\": \"https://cdn.skypack.dev/react\",\n    \"@/utils\": \"./src/utils/index.js\"\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import _ from 'lodash';\n  import React from 'react';\n  import { helper } from '@/utils';\n</script>\n```\n\n### Import Assertions\n\nSpecify the expected type of imported modules.\n\n```javascript\n// Import JSON\nimport config from './config.json' assert { type: 'json' };\n\n// Import CSS (future)\nimport styles from './styles.css' assert { type: 'css' };\n\n// Dynamic imports with assertions\nconst data = await import('./data.json', {\n  assert: { type: 'json' }\n});\n```\n\n## Error Handling Improvements\n\n### AggregateError\n\nRepresent multiple errors in a single error object.\n\n```javascript\nasync function processItems(items) {\n  const errors = [];\n  const results = [];\n  \n  for (const item of items) {\n    try {\n      const result = await processItem(item);\n      results.push(result);\n    } catch (error) {\n      errors.push(error);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  if (errors.length > 0) {\n    throw new AggregateError(errors, 'Some items failed to process');\n  }\n  \n  return results;\n}\n\n// Usage\ntry {\n  await processItems(items);\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error instanceof AggregateError) {\n    error.errors.forEach(err => console.error(err));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Error Cause\n\nChain errors while preserving the original cause.\n\n```javascript\nfunction processData(data) {\n  try {\n    return JSON.parse(data);\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw new Error('Failed to process data', { cause: error });\n  }\n}\n\ntry {\n  processData(invalidJSON);\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log(error.message); // 'Failed to process data'\n  console.log(error.cause); // Original JSON parsing error\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices for Modern JavaScript\n\n### Code Organization\n\n1. **Use ES Modules consistently**\n2. **Leverage tree shaking** for smaller bundles\n3. **Organize code by feature**, not by file type\n4. **Use barrel exports** for clean imports\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n1. **Use optional chaining judiciously** (slight performance cost)\n2. **Prefer const over let** when possible\n3. **Use BigInt only when necessary** (performance overhead)\n4. **Leverage WeakMap/WeakSet** for memory efficiency\n\n### Compatibility and Polyfills\n\n```javascript\n// Feature detection\nif ('at' in Array.prototype) {\n  // Use native implementation\n  console.log(arr.at(-1));\n} else {\n  // Fallback\n  console.log(arr[arr.length - 1]);\n}\n\n// Using core-js for polyfills\nimport 'core-js/actual/array/at';\nimport 'core-js/actual/object/has-own';\n```\n\n## Future JavaScript Features to Watch\n\n### Pattern Matching (Proposal)\n\n```javascript\n// Future syntax (proposal)\nconst result = match (value) {\n  when Number if value > 0 => 'positive',\n  when Number if value < 0 => 'negative',\n  when 0 => 'zero',\n  when String => 'text',\n  else => 'unknown'\n};\n```\n\n### Pipeline Operator (Proposal)\n\n```javascript\n// Future syntax (proposal)\nconst result = value\n  |> transform\n  |> validate\n  |> process\n  |> finalize;\n```\n\n### Decorators (Stage 3)\n\n```javascript\n// Stage 3 proposal\nclass ApiService {\n  @cache(60000)\n  @retry(3)\n  async fetchData(url) {\n    return fetch(url).then(r => r.json());\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nModern JavaScript offers powerful features that can significantly improve your development experience and code quality. By mastering these features, you can:\n\n- Write more concise and readable code\n- Handle errors more effectively\n- Build more performant applications\n- Stay current with industry standards\n- Prepare for future language evolution\n\nThe key to success is to gradually adopt these features in your projects, understanding not just how to use them, but when and why to use them. Start with the basics like optional chaining and nullish coalescing, then progress to more advanced features like proxies and async generators as your needs grow.\n\nRemember that with great power comes great responsibility – use these features judiciously and always consider your target audience and browser support requirements. Happy coding!\n\n**Keep learning, keep experimenting, and most importantly, keep building amazing things with JavaScript!**"

      "content": "# Building Scalable React Applications\n\nAs your React project grows, structuring it properly becomes essential. This blog outlines best practices for building React applications that are maintainable, performant, and scalable over time.\n\n## Why Scalability Matters\nA scalable React app:\n- Handles increasing complexity and team size\n- Allows for easy feature expansion\n- Maintains performance and readability\n\n## 1. Feature-Based Folder Structure\nOrganize files by feature rather than file type.\n\n```bash\nsrc/\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   └── dashboard/\n├── components/\n├── utils/\n└── App.js\n```\n\nThis keeps related files together and improves developer experience.\n\n## 2. Component Reusability\nCreate small, reusable components that follow the single responsibility principle.\n\n```jsx\n// Good: Break large UI blocks into Header, Footer, Card, etc.\n```\n\nUse container (logic) and presentational (UI) component patterns where useful.\n\n## 3. State Management\nUse local state for UI-specific logic and global state only when necessary.\n\nRecommended tools:\n- Context API (lightweight)\n- Redux Toolkit (standardized)\n- Zustand or Jotai (simpler alternatives)\n\n## 4. Custom Hooks\nEncapsulate reusable logic in custom hooks.\n\n```jsx\nfunction useAuth() {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  return { user, login, logout };\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Lazy Loading and Code Splitting\nUse React.lazy and Suspense to improve load times.\n\n```jsx\nconst Profile = React.lazy(() => import('./Profile'));\n```\n\n## 6. Type Safety\nUse TypeScript for large codebases to reduce bugs and improve maintainability.\nIf using JavaScript, at least use PropTypes.\n\n## 7. Use Environment Variables\nStore API keys and URLs in .env files.\n\n```env\nREACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com\n```\n\n## 8. Linting, Formatting, and Testing\n- ESLint for static code analysis\n- Prettier for consistent code style\n- React Testing Library + Jest for testing\n\n## 9. Absolute Imports\nConfigure jsconfig.json for cleaner import paths.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 10. Optimize Performance\n- Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo wisely\n- Minimize unnecessary re-renders\n- Monitor with React DevTools\n\n## Conclusion\nScalability comes from good structure, separation of concerns, and performance awareness. Following these practices will help you build robust and maintainable React apps ready for any challenge."

It’s essential for frontend development, widely used in backend (Node.js), and critical in interviews for junior to senior developer roles. This guide provides an extensive collection of JavaScript interview questions with answers, categorized for easy reference, including real interview, analytical, and coding questions.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Table of Contents\n1. Core Concepts\n2. Scope, Hoisting & Closures\n3. Functions & Objects\n4. Arrays & ES6 Features\n5. Asynchronous JavaScript\n6. Advanced Topics\n7. OOP in JavaScript\n8. DOM & Events\n9. Error Handling\n10. Analytical & Coding Questions\n11. Miscellaneous & Tricky Questions\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 1. Core Concepts\n\n### 1. What are primitive data types in JavaScript?\nString, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt\n\n### 2. What is `typeof null` and why?\n`typeof null` returns `'object'` — a historical bug in JavaScript.\n\n### 3. What’s the difference between `==` and `===`?\n`==` compares with type coercion, `===` compares with no coercion (strict equality).\n\n### 4. Explain implicit and explicit type coercion.\n- Implicit: JS converts types automatically (e.g., `'5' == 5`).\n- Explicit: Using `String()`, `Number()`, `Boolean()`.\n\n### 5. What is NaN? How do you check for it?\n`NaN` stands for Not-a-Number. Check with `Number.isNaN(x)`.\n\n### 6. What is the difference between `undefined` and `null`?\n- `undefined`: variable declared but not assigned.\n- `null`: intentional absence of any value.\n\n### 7. **Real Interview Question**: Why is JavaScript considered loosely typed?\nJavaScript allows variables to change types dynamically and performs type coercion during operations, unlike strictly typed languages like TypeScript.\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 2. Scope, Hoisting & Closures\n\n### 8. What is scope in JavaScript?\nScope determines the visibility of variables — global, function, block.\n\n### 9. What is lexical scope?\nChild functions have access to variables defined in their outer scope.\n\n### 10. Explain hoisting with examples.\nVariables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope.\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(a); // undefined\nvar a = 5;\n```\n\n### 11. What is a closure?\nA closure gives access to an outer function’s scope even after the outer function has returned.\n\n### 12. **Real Interview Question**: What will the following code output?\n```javascript\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);\n}\n```\n**Answer**: Outputs `3, 3, 3` because `var` is function-scoped, and `setTimeout` callbacks reference the same `i` after the loop ends. Using `let` would output `0, 1, 2` due to block scoping.\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 3. Functions & Objects\n\n### 13. What’s the difference between function declaration and expression?\n- Declaration: `function fn() {}` (hoisted)\n- Expression: `const fn = function() {}` (not hoisted)\n\n### 14. What is the difference between arrow functions and regular functions?\nArrow functions:\n- Do not bind `this`\n- Cannot be used as constructors\n- Do not have `arguments` object\n\n### 15. What is `this` in JavaScript?\nThe context object depending on how a function is called.\n\n### 16. How does `bind`, `call`, and `apply` work?\n```javascript\nfunc.call(obj, arg1, arg2);\nfunc.apply(obj, [arg1, arg2]);\nconst bound = func.bind(obj);\n```\n\n### 17. How do objects behave in JavaScript?\nObjects are key-value pairs, keys are strings or symbols.\n\n### 18. **Real Interview Question**: How would you create a deep copy of an object?\nUse `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` for simple objects or a recursive function for complex cases:\n```javascript\nfunction deepCopy(obj) {\n  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) return obj;\n  const copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};\n  for (let key in obj) {\n    copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key]);\n  }\n  return copy;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 4. Arrays & ES6 Features\n\n### 19. Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`\n- `map`: returns a new array\n- `filter`: filters items\n- `reduce`: accumulates values\n- `find`: returns first match\n\n### 20. What is destructuring?\n```javascript\nconst {name, age} = user;\nconst [a, b] = [1, 2];\n```\n\n### 21. What are rest and spread operators?\n- Rest: `...args` collects arguments\n- Spread: `...arr` expands arrays/objects\n\n### 22. What is a template literal?\n```javascript\nconst name = `Hi ${userName}`;\n```\n\n### 23. What is optional chaining?\n```javascript\nuser?.address?.city\n```\n\n### 24. **Real Interview Question**: How would you flatten a nested array?\nUse `Array.prototype.flat()` or recursion:\n```javascript\nfunction flatten(arr) {\n  return arr.reduce((flat, item) => flat.concat(Array.isArray(item) ? flatten(item) : item), []);\n}\nconsole.log(flatten([1, [2, [3, 4], 5]])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 5. Asynchronous JavaScript\n\n### 25. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?\n- Sync: blocking\n- Async: non-blocking (callbacks, promises, async/await)\n\n### 26. What is a callback?\nA function passed to another function to be executed later.\n\n### 27. What is a Promise?\nAn object representing the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.\n\n### 28. How does async/await work?\nSyntactic sugar over promises for better readability.\n\n```javascript\nasync function fetchData() {\n  const res = await fetch('api/data');\n  const data = await res.json();\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\n### 29. What is the event loop?\nHandles the call stack and task queue to execute code asynchronously.\n\n### 30. **Real Interview Question**: What will this code output and why?\n```javascript\nconsole.log('Start');\nsetTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);\nPromise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));\nconsole.log('End');\n```\n**Answer**: Outputs `Start`, `End`, `Promise`, `Timeout`. The event loop prioritizes microtasks (Promise) over macrotasks (setTimeout).\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 6. Advanced Topics\n\n### 31. What is currying?\n```javascript\nfunction add(a) {\n  return function(b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 32. What is memoization?\nCaching results of expensive function calls.\n\n### 33. What is debounce vs throttle?\n- Debounce: delays execution until inactivity\n- Throttle: limits execution to a fixed rate\n\n### 34. What is prototype and prototypal inheritance?\nAll JS objects inherit from a prototype object.\n\n### 35. Difference between shallow and deep copy?\n- Shallow: copies reference\n- Deep: copies entire structure\n\n### 36. **Real Interview Question**: Implement a throttle function.\n```javascript\nfunction throttle(fn, delay) {\n  let lastCall = 0;\n  return function (...args) {\n    const now = Date.now();\n    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {\n      lastCall = now;\n      return fn(...args);\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 7. OOP in JavaScript\n\n### 37. How do you create a class?\n```javascript\nclass Person {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n  greet() {\n    return `Hi ${this.name}`;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 38. What is inheritance in classes?\n```javascript\nclass Student extends Person {\n  constructor(name, grade) {\n    super(name);\n    this.grade = grade;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 39. What is encapsulation?\nHiding internal implementation using private fields (using `#`).\n\n### 40. **Real Interview Question**: How would you implement a private method in a class?\n```javascript\nclass Example {\n  #privateMethod() {\n    return 'This is private!';\n  }\n  publicMethod() {\n    return this.#privateMethod();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 8. DOM & Events\n\n### 41. How do you select elements in DOM?\n- `document.querySelector()`\n- `document.getElementById()`\n\n### 42. How do you add events?\n```javascript\nelement.addEventListener('click', handler);\n```\n\n### 43. Event bubbling vs capturing?\n- Bubbling: inside → out\n- Capturing: out → in\n\n### 44. What is event delegation?\nUsing one listener for multiple child elements via propagation.\n\n### 45. **Real Interview Question**: Implement event delegation for a list.\n```javascript\nconst ul = document.querySelector('ul');\nul.addEventListener('click', (e) => {\n  if (e.target.tagName === 'LI') {\n    console.log(e.target.textContent);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 9. Error Handling\n\n### 46. What are the ways to handle errors?\n- `try...catch`\n- `.catch()` on promises\n\n### 47. What is `finally` block?\nExecutes regardless of error being thrown or not.\n\n### 48. **Real Interview Question**: How would you handle errors in async/await?\n```javascript\nasync function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch('api/data');\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n    return await res.json();\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error:', error.message);\n  } finally {\n    console.log('Request completed');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 10. Analytical & Coding Questions\n\n### 49. **Analytical Question**: Design a function to detect a cycle in a linked list.\n**Answer**: Use Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm:\n```javascript\nfunction hasCycle(head) {\n  let slow = head, fast = head;\n  while (fast && fast.next) {\n    slow = slow.next;\n    fast = fast.next.next;\n    if (slow === fast) return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n**Explanation**: Two pointers move at different speeds; if they meet, a cycle exists.\n\n### 50. **Coding Question**: Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in methods.\n```javascript\nfunction reverseString(str) {\n  let result = '';\n  for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    result += str[i];\n  }\n  return result;\n}\nconsole.log(reverseString('hello')); // 'olleh'\n```\n\n### 51. **Analytical Question**: How would you optimize a function that checks for duplicates in an array?\n**Answer**: Use a Set for O(n) time complexity:\n```javascript\nfunction hasDuplicates(arr) {\n  return new Set(arr).size !== arr.length;\n}\nconsole.log(hasDuplicates([1, 2, 2, 3])); // true\n```\n**Explanation**: A Set stores unique values, so comparing its size to the array’s length detects duplicates efficiently.\n\n### 52. **Coding Question**: Implement a function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.\n```javascript\nfunction firstNonRepeating(str) {\n  const charCount = {};\n  for (let char of str) {\n    charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;\n  }\n  for (let char of str) {\n    if (charCount[char] === 1) return char;\n  }\n  return null;\n}\nconsole.log(firstNonRepeating('aabbc')); // 'c'\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 11. Miscellaneous & Tricky Questions\n\n### 53. What is the output of:\n```javascript\nconsole.log([] + []); // \"\"\nconsole.log([] + {}); // \"[object Object]\"\nconsole.log({} + []); // \"[object Object]\"\n```\n\n### 54. What is IIFE?\nImmediately Invoked Function Expression:\n```javascript\n(function(){ console.log(\"Hi\") })();\n```\n\n### 55. What is the use of `setTimeout(fn, 0)`?\nSchedules code to run after the current call stack is cleared.\n\n### 56. How do modules work in JS?\n- ES Modules: `import`/`export`\n- CommonJS (Node.js): `require`/`module.exports`\n\n### 57. How to check if a variable is an array?\n```javascript\nArray.isArray(var)\n```\n\n### 58. How does `new` keyword work?\nCreates a new object, sets `this`, and links prototype.\n\n### 59. **Real Interview Question**: What will this code output?\n```javascript\nlet x = 10;\nfunction fn() {\n  console.log(x);\n  var x = 20;\n}\nfn();\n```\n**Answer**: Outputs `undefined` due to hoisting; `var x = 20` is hoisted, making `x` undefined before assignment.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Final Tips\n- Revise core concepts repeatedly\n- Practice coding problems daily\n- Prepare STAR-format answers for experience-based questions\n- Explain thought processes clearly in interviews\n- Test edge cases in coding solutions\n\n**🚀 You’re now ready to crush your next JavaScript interview!**"
